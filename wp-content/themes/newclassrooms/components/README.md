## Components
Global components that are NOT part of Gutenberg/FLEX editing experience. 

### Adding components
To create a new acf component, duplicate `components/component_template` in the child `components` folder and rename as per naming conventions below. 

If an existing ACF component needs to be edited for the project, copy the component folder to the child's `components` folder and make changes there. Changes made to this component in the child theme will override existing. 

#### How to use a component in a front end template:
To include a component in a front end template:
Include it where needed:
`echo Utils::render_template('components/component_name/component-name.php', array());`

Values/variables can be passed into the component template in the array in the `Utils::render_template` function.  To use them in the component template, `$this->varName`.


#### To add Front End JS to a new component:
- In the component markup, on the outer most div, add `data-component-name="JSComponentName"`
- If it's an existing component, use the existing function name.  If it's a new component, create a new JS file and place in the component folder. 

### Naming Conventions
- Component Folders: `component_component-name`
- Component Markup: `component-name.php`
- Component SCSS: `_component-name.scss`
- Component Front End JS: `_component-name.js`
- Component ReadMe: `README_component-name.md`
- Component ACF Fields: This file will be autogenerated with the field group ID.
- Component Register ACF Fields: `register_component-name.php`
